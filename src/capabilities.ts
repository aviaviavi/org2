      "Use the Celorga CLI by default for Org operations; prefer exposed Celorga workspace/MCP tools where supported, and honor client-required effective-text reads and reviewed writes.",
      "Celorga is independent of Emacs. Do not assume Emacs is installed or invoke emacs, emacsclient, batch Emacs Lisp, or Org exporters as an implicit fallback. Use Emacs only for an explicitly requested Emacs-specific task.",
      "Before declaring a capability gap, check the installed version, capabilities, and command help. Distinguish missing executables, permissions, and unavailable tools from missing features. Use a supported reviewable alternative without bypassing access or review boundaries; never silently execute unsupported formulas or source blocks through GNU Org.",
      "For a confirmed gap, reproduce and fix it with a regression test when authorized to develop Celorga in its repository. Otherwise suggest https://github.com/aviaviavi/celorga/issues and prepare a sanitized version, command/tool, minimal input, expected/actual behavior, and workaround report. Do not publish issues or private corpus content without user authorization.",
      "The CLI is `celorga`. Corpus configuration lives in celorga.json.",
      "Run `celorga --help` for command families and `celorga COMMAND --help` for current flags.",
      "Run `celorga version` or `celorga --version` to inspect the installed package version.",
      "Prefer JSON output for integrations (`--format json` or `--json` where supported).",
      "Use `celorga agent context|search|fetch|bundle` for bounded, cited corpus retrieval.",
      "Use `celorga run --help` for durable delegated work, `celorga workflow` for reusable recipes, and `celorga mcp serve` for local MCP discovery. A headless Celorga server can expose the same retrieval tools through read-only Streamable HTTP MCP.",
      "Use `celorga workflow create` for a plain prompt automation with optional file-owned model and reasoning effort, `celorga workflow due` for destination-neutral schedule checks, and preview-first `celorga workflow delete` to remove a definition without erasing run history; the Celorga app can dispatch due attempts to any configured AI destination.",
      "Use `celorga goal` for durable outcomes and `celorga agent-profile` for portable named workers plus runtime bindings; resolve a runtime agent ID before creating delegated work.",
      "Use read-only `celorga doctor --dir CORPUS --json` to find contradictory run, approval, workflow-attempt, and projected headline state before an agent acts.",
      "Use `celorga run show ID --with-revision --json` when a client needs a revision token for a later guarded mutation.",
      "Celorga renders completed HTML source blocks as live previews in AI chat and the reader with expandable source: inline JavaScript runs and may load HTTPS libraries and data inside an opaque-origin sandbox that cannot reach the chat, corpus, local files, or app, and the frame sizes to its content unless `:height N` is given. Use one for interactive boards, simulations, calculators, or diagrams. Reviewed workspace edits accept .html, .htm, and .xhtml files for standalone interactive pages, retaining SHA-bound previews and stale-write protection.",
      "Use `celorga thread post THREAD_ID ... --apply` or the MCP tool `celorga_thread_post` when an explicitly asynchronous worker must report into a named AI chat; a post is context only unless `--request-turn AGENT` (MCP `requestTurn`) asks shared-room agents to respond. Single-agent chats reject that flag; use preview-first `celorga thread send THREAD_ID --message TEXT --idempotency-key KEY --apply` to enqueue a user turn through the existing destination queue (a follow-up while busy). This requires a consumer supporting send-message:v1; older consumers retain the request as unsupported. Delivery status and turn status are separate: queuing or delivering a request does not confirm a started turn. Pass the target thread ID and a stable idempotency key into delegated work. In a shared room, an agent reply that @mentions another room agent starts that agent's turn; `celorga thread configure THREAD --agent-turn-limit N|default` caps back-to-back agent-requested turns (default 4, 0 turns hand-offs off) before a person must reply.",
      "Use `celorga activity explain --json` (optionally `--thread|--run|--workflow ID`) to learn why work is running or blocked before acting, `celorga activity events --follow --json` for an NDJSON stream of run, approval, thread, workflow, and host transitions, and `celorga thread wait ID --until reply|needs-you|idle` or `celorga run wait ID --until approval|blocked|completed` for race-free coordination; waits check durable state first and exit 0 matched, 2 unreachable, 124 timed out.",
      "Use `celorga thread repair --dir CORPUS --json` on macOS to preview deterministic transcript reconciliation through the native OpenOrgServer worker; `--apply` commits a new repair head without changing original writer heads. `--watch --interval SECONDS --apply` runs without an LLM and skips unchanged chat storage. Build the worker with npm run build:server or supply --executable PATH. Desktop Settings and server chat-repair configure the background check interval; 0/off disables it.",
      "Use `celorga ledger` for stable per-account bookkeeping in recurring workflows; canonical accounts live under `notes/LEDGER/accounts/`.",
      "Use `celorga corpus show|validate|init` to inspect or establish portable corpus identity before team mounting.",
      "Use `celorga source list|doctor|status|bind|import|sync` to manage corpus-declared Slack and Notion crawler profiles and IMAP email profiles, add or update any profile type with `celorga source add PROFILE --source-json JSON` (or `celorga source add-email`), and stage review packets without storing credentials in the corpus; email sync is read-only and incremental.",
      "Use `celorga plugin actions --context note|heading|thread|run|approval` and `celorga plugin action run PLUGIN:ACTION` for context-aware plugin actions, and `celorga plugin hooks dispatch --apply` for lifecycle hooks (run.blocked, run.completed, approval.requested, thread.reply-received, ...). Both are sandboxed and only return proposals; review them with `celorga plugin proposals list|apply|dismiss` (preview by default, `--apply` to write).",
      "Use `celorga plugin list|doctor` to inspect corpus-declared extensions, `plugin sync` to reproduce the content-addressed lock, and `plugin update` to advance a Git ref deliberately.",

      "Preserve file and line citations, IDs, provenance, source hashes, and review state when deriving artifacts.",
      "Never block a durable run without an actionable clarification; `celorga run block ID --reason TEXT` requires the specific question or next action. A run with a pending approval must stay waiting-approval unless an independent blocker is explicitly declared with `--separate-from-approval`; approval-shaped reasons are rejected even with that override.",
      "Never complete a durable run without a concise result for the reviewer; `celorga run complete ID --summary TEXT` requires a human-readable outcome and accepts repeatable highlights and next actions.",
      "A run with a pending approval cannot be completed normally; record the request, stop before the protected action, and resume only after the approval decision returns the run to running.",
      "Treat `celorga approvals` as the unified pending-decision queue: decide `kind=run` items by their exact runId/approvalId through `celorga run approval-decide`, and mutate `kind=headline` items only at their cited source heading. A headline carrying `ORG2_RUN_ID` that resolves to a canonical run approval is a derived projection and is not a second writable decision. Provider-backed items expose `decisionKeys`; preserve the exact `Provider draft: PROVIDER:TOOL:DRAFT_ID` line so `approval-request` reuses the current durable decision and `approval-decide` closes older duplicate projections.",
      "Use `celorga run approval-resolve --decision-key KEY --json` when an execution guard needs the canonical pending or decided provider authority. Private adapter state is only a cache and must not override this CLI resolution.",
      "Run approvals carry a SHA-256 fingerprint over immutable review material. Pass the queue item's fingerprint back to `run approval-decide --fingerprint` so stale or substituted actions fail closed across clients.",
      "A `run approval-decide --decision revised` request must include `--note \"Requested changes\"`; revision feedback is stored as the decision note and does not authorize the protected action.",
      "Approval decisions are item-scoped: rejecting or canceling one action leaves sibling approvals pending, and the run resumes only after the current boundary is fully decided, executing approved actions while excluding rejected or canceled ones. A client recording that one approval was completed elsewhere must cancel only that approval with an external receipt; it must not complete the containing run. Use `revised` with a concrete note when replacement material is required.",
      "Scheduled workflow runs use a stable logicalWorkId plus distinct numbered attempt records. A schedule with an event/fresh-path gate is skipped until `workflow signal` records matching work after the prior attempt.",
      "Use `celorga server` for a standalone macOS relay, scheduler, and optional read-only Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint. Server configuration and MCP token hashes are machine-local; plaintext access tokens are shown once and must never enter the corpus. `server assign --host-ref HOST` writes only a symbolic automation owner to celorga.json. iOS selects one paired host at a time; independently synced corpus copies are not a distributed lock.",
      "The Celorga scheduler catches up only the latest missed occurrence and refuses overlapping queued, running, blocked, or approval-waiting attempts. An unavailable explicit AI destination fails visibly; it must never silently reroute the prompt.",
      "Deleting a workflow is preview-first and removes only its canonical definition; preserve prior runs and never imply that deleting the definition cancels work already dispatched to a runtime.",
      "A run with a review-required artifact cannot be completed normally; after the human decision, use `celorga run artifact-review RUN_ID ARTIFACT_ID --status reviewed|rejected --actor NAME` to update both the durable run and linked Org artifact before completion.",
      "When a person confirms that an unfinished run's outcome was completed outside the workflow, `celorga run complete-external ID --summary TEXT --actor NAME` records that explicit resolution while preserving unresolved approvals and review metadata as history; agents must not infer this resolution on their own.",
      "Use `celorga run reopen-external ID --summary TEXT --actor NAME` only to repair a run mistakenly completed externally from `waiting-approval`; it restores the same run and retained approval identities to the pending queue.",
      "Record observable runtime metadata with `celorga run runtime ID` when provider, model, token usage, cost, or elapsed time is available; never put credentials in a run record.",
      "Treat OpenClaw, Codex, Claude Code, Pi, and OpenCode as runtimes, not agent identities. Store named workers under agent-profiles/, bind non-secret runtime agent IDs there, and preserve resolved agentRef/goalRef on runs, workflows, and delegated headings.",
      "Run targeted tests plus `celorga lint` around writes when practical; never put secrets in notes or generated artifacts.",
      "Never infer agent access from corpora remembered by a person's app; every federated CLI mount must be explicit.",
      "Single-document publishing strips private Org metadata and raw HTML before rendering every format. A static web bundle does not implement viewer authentication; its host must enforce any secret-link or per-person access policy, while Google Drive owns permissions for Docs, Slides, Sheets, and PDF files.",
      "Treat `celorga doctor` as a read-only consistency check. Review its evidence before repairing canonical state; the command never mutates files automatically.",
      "Run and workflow mutations use atomic guarded writes. Pass `--if-revision sha256:...` when carrying run state across requests; a stale revision, concurrent writer, duplicate create, or out-of-band readable-state edit fails instead of silently overwriting newer source.",
